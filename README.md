## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on improving 3D perception for autonomous vehicles by addressing the limitations of sparse or occluded LiDAR point clouds. Using **point-based neural networks**, the model predicts and reconstructs missing geometry to produce more complete and accurate 3D representations, supporting downstream tasks such as **object detection**, **tracking**, and **motion planning**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation
Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on LiDAR and camera sensors for environment perception. However, real-world point clouds are often incomplete due to **occlusions**, **sparse sampling**, or **sensor noise**.
